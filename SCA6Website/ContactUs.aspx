											Please feel free to  <a href="mailto:sca6net@gmail.com">e-mail</a> to join, ask questions, or share information that you think might be helpful to others with SCA6. Personal information is not required to join.
                                            Once we have a connected group, we will begin a teleconference series with short educational agendas and time for open discussion.

                                            Though not specific for SCA6, the <a href="https://ataxia.org/">National Ataxia Foundation (NAF)</a> has information about all ataxia types, research and advocacy, including organized ataxia groups and events at ataxia.org. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The aim of the SCA6 Network is to supplement the information offered by broader NAF with information and effort specific for people affected by SCA6.
