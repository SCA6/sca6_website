											<h3>General information</h3>

										<p>
											Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA6) is a rare, slowly progressive, disease that can result
                                            in dizziness, difficulty with balance, vision disturbances, and difficulty with speaking
                                            clearly. These symptoms are often not experienced until later in life, but can occur 
                                            earlier with a usual range of presentation between 43 and 52 years of age. One difference 
                                            between SCA6 and other ataxia types is that the progression of symptoms tends to be slow. 
                                            Life expectancy and mentation (ability to think and remember clearly) does not seem to be 
                                            altered by SCA6.
										</p>
										<p>
											SCA6 can be diagnosed by collecting and testing saliva. An individual who wants to be tested
                                            can request a saliva kit through a qualified physician and often with an offer of genetic 
                                            counseling. Either in the office or at home, the individual spits into a tube to collect the
                                            saliva. The saliva specimen is then mailed to the testing lab. The result is provided to the
                                            physician who then shares it with the requesting individual. Genetic counseling may be offered
                                            for those who want it. There are laws against genetic discrimination by health insurance companies
                                            and employers; however, life insurance companies are less restricted. As such, an individual
                                            may choose to pay out-of-pocket for genetic testing to assure the confidentiality of the results.
										</p>

											SCA6 is caused by an increase in CAG repeats in the CACNA1A gene. Affected individuals have 20 to 
                                            33 repeats; unaffected individuals have 18 or fewer CAG repeats; the clinical presentation with 19 
                                            repeats is variable. The increased number of repeats in the CACNA1A gene results in creation of an 
                                            abnormal protein that can lead to loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Purkinje cells in the 
                                            cerebellum are important for balance and speech. The damage to the cerebellum can be detected by 
                                            MRI imaging of the brain with a decrease in size of the cerebellum. Of note, MRI may be performed
                                            before genetics testing. With a family history of SCA6 and thinning of the cerebellum identified 
                                            by MRI, the individual likely does have SCA6, but still may want confirmation by genetic testing.
                                            Of note, MRI results do NOT correlate with symptoms. In other words, some people with severe 
                                            cerebellar degradation have almost no symptoms; others with very little degradation have severe symptoms.
										</p>

											Inheritance: The risk of SCA6 in children of affected individuals is 50%. SCA6 is inherited in an 
                                            autosomal dominant manner meaning that abnormal CAG expansion on just one chromosome causes the disease.
                                            At times, the symptoms of the disease are so late onset and/or so mild that SCA6 may not be diagnosed. 
                                            Children of such individuals still likely have a 50% risk for SCA6.
										</p>
										<p>
											It is possible to perform preimplantation diagnosis and in vitro fertilization if a couple with an affected 
                                            or even at risk individual were planning a pregnancy and desired this. An embryo could be selected that lacks
                                            the CAG expansion for implantation. Due to the general risks, costs, inconvenience, and potential complications,
                                            such as twins or spontaneous loss of the baby, with such a procedure, and because SCA6 is usually such a 
                                            mild late onset disease, this may not be advisable, but it is an option. Genetic testing of children is 
                                            strongly discouraged because of the late onset and mild nature of SCA6 with no way to prevent the onset 
                                            of SCA6 symptoms currently available.

										</p>Communication about SCA6 with family members and others is a serious and sensitive issue. It
                                        is important to respect confidentiality of affected and at-risk individuals and their wishes regarding communication.
