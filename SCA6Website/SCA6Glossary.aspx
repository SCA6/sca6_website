<u>DNA;  nucleotide</u><br />
                                        <strong>DNA</strong> is the molecule that carries the information required for a single cell to develop into a fully grown organism. 
                                        DNA is made of simpler units called <strong>nucleotides</strong>, linked together. Two chains of nucleotides (strands) wind around each other to form a double helix. 
                                        The variable part of a nucleotide is a chemical group called a base. There are four different bases (A, C, G and T), and the order in which they occur 
                                        is referred to as the DNA sequence – it is this that carries (encodes) the information. (Chemically, DNA, RNA and antisense oligonucleotides are nucleic acids.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>RNA</strong> is closely related to DNA, and performs many different functions within the cell. Whereas DNA is double-stranded, RNA is single-stranded (as are antisense oligonucleotides). 
                                        RNA is copied from DNA by a process called transcription. 

</p>
<p>
<strong>mRNA</strong> (messenger RNA) is an essential intermediate between a gene and the protein that it encodes. 

</p>
<p>
A<strong> miRNA (micro RNA)</strong> is a short strand of RNA used by the cell to help control the expression of a gene.

</p>
<p>
An <strong>antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)</strong> is a short single-stranded nucleic acid designed to be used as a drug. Various chemical modifications enhance stability, uptake into cells and target binding, and minimize toxicity.

</p>
<p>
<u>Gene;  codon;  amino acid;  protein</u><br />
A <strong>gene</strong> is a stretch of DNA that encodes a protein or RNA product. For genes encoding proteins, the bases are read in groups of three, and each group is known as a <strong>codon</strong>. 
                                        Each codon specifies a building block called an <strong>amino acid</strong> – and a chain of these forms a <strong>protein</strong>. The correspondence between codons and amino acids is called the genetic code. 
                                        The order of amino acids is sufficient to determine the structure and properties of a protein. 

</p>
<p>
<strong>Glutamine</strong> is one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, and is represented  by the letter ‘Q’. Two codons (CAG and CAA) specify glutamine. 
                                        Within the CACNA1A gene, a CAG tract (ie. CAGCAGCAG...) encodes the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract (ie. QQQ...) that occurs in the proteins α1A and α1ACT.

</p>
<p>
A <strong>mutation</strong> is a change in the sequence of DNA, inherited by the offspring of an organism. In SCA6, the change is an increase in the length of the CAG tract – resulting in an increase in the 
                                        length (an expansion) of the polyQ tract. 

</p>
<p>
<strong>Gene expression</strong> is the process of converting the information content of a gene into protein or RNA products.

</p>
<p>
<u>Transcription;  transcription factor</u><br />
<strong>Transcription</strong> is the process by which the information content of DNA is copied into RNA. (Transcription is performed by a protein called RNA polymerase, which is under the control of many 
                                        different <strong>transcription factors</strong>. The protein α1ACT functions as a transcription factor.)

</p>
<p>
<u>Translation;  ribosome</u><br />
<strong>Translation</strong> is the process by which the information content of mRNA is decoded to make protein. (Translation is performed by <strong>ribosomes</strong>, enormous complexes containing RNAs and proteins).
</p>
<p>
An <strong>IRES</strong> is a specialized stretch of mRNA that adopts a complex 3D structure. This structure can be recognized by ribosomes, which are ‘tricked’ into starting translation within – 
                                        rather than at the beginning of – the message. The existence of an IRES cannot be predicted from the mRNA sequence, and therefore must be proved experimentally. 

</p>
<p>
A <strong>voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC)</strong> spans the neuronal cell membrane and allows calcium ions to enter in response to electrical activity; 
                                        this is important for neuron function. A complete VGCC comprises several protein subunits. The CACNA1A gene encodes the main pore-forming 
                                        subunit (α1A) of one particular (‘P/Q’) type of VGCC.
