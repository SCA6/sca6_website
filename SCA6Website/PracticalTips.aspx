											<h2>Practical Tips</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											General Health: Try to maintain a healthy weight. Exercise to increase muscle strength 
                                            and balance. Exercise does not stop disease progression, but can “train” body to 
                                            compensate for as long as possible. Consider physical therapy. Consider stopping or 
                                            reducing drinking of alcohol because alcohol exacerbates symptoms of speech difficulty 
                                            and balance. Perspective: These healthy habits are good for everyone, whether affected, 
                                            at risk, or a caregiver. Apparently, it is trendy now with the next generation to drink
                                            non-alcoholic fancy drinks that are hydrating and fun with the pleasant side-affect that
                                            you feel well the next morning.

											Home modifications: Home modifications are important for safety and convenience, such
                                            as night lights, canes, walking sticks, and walkers to prevent falling, shower mats and
                                            safety bars or chair for shower may be helpful. Consider weighted eating utensils and
                                            dressing hooks to help with eating and dressing. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Movement: Annual or semiannual evaluation by a neurologist. Physical therapists can help
                                            focus exercise on retention of muscle strength and balance. Acetazolamide may decrease episodes
                                            of ataxia. Vestibular suppressants may reduce vertigo. Tremor-controlling drugs are not usually
                                            effective in reducing cerebellar tremors. Driving ability should be assessed by professionals
                                            periodically.

											Sight: Ophthalmology consultation may help with refractive or surgical management of diplopia.
										</p>
										<p>
											Speech: Speech therapy and communication devices may help with dysarthria. 
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Eating: Consider feeding assessment if dysphagia becomes troublesome. Video esophagrams
                                            may help identify safest behaviors and consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration.
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Sleep: CPAP may help with sleep apnea. Clonopin may help with REM sleep disturbance. Avoid sedative hypnotics that increase incoordination.
