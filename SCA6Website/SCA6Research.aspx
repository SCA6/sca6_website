											Gomez Laboratory and Website:
                                            Dr. Gomez is a clinical neurologist and researcher with a laboratory dedicated to SCA6 research.
                                            We feel encouraged by the amazing progress by the Gomez laboratory to understand the cause of
                                            SCA6 and to develop a therapy to stop the progression of symptoms. The immediate vision of the
                                            SCA6 Network is to provide help to translate his research into a clinical trial to stop the 
                                            progression of SCA6 symptoms. To learn more, visit his SCA6 research website at <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/gomezlab">GomezLab</a>

											Publications of Interest: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1900907">This</a> article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine describing a successful
                                            clinical trial using RNA-based therapy for Huntington disease. Even though not SCA6, we are 
                                            hopeful that a similar RNA-based strategy, though specific to SCA6 as conceived by Dr. Gomez 
                                            in his mouse model for SCA6, might provide hope for an effective clinical trial in the future
                                            to prevent progression of SCA6 symptoms.
